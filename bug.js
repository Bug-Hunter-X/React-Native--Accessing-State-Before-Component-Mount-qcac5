This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before the component has mounted. This commonly happens when using asynchronous operations within the component's lifecycle methods, such as `componentDidMount` or `componentWillMount` (deprecated in React 16.3 and removed in React 17).  The component tries to use data that hasn't been fetched or rendered yet. 

Example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    data: null,
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('some_api_endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        this.setState({ data });
        console.log(this.state.data.someProperty); //Error here:  data might still be null
      });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        {/* Incorrect usage, data may not be available yet */}
        <Text>{this.state.data.someProperty}</Text> 
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
