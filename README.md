# React Native: Accessing State Before Component Mount

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access component state or props before the component has fully mounted. This often occurs when using asynchronous operations like fetching data within lifecycle methods.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file showcases the issue: the component attempts to access and use fetched data before it's available, resulting in an error. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version. It uses the `useEffect` hook (or `componentDidMount` for class components) along with the `state` to conditionally render content only after data has been fetched and state is updated.
